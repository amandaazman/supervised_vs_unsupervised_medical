# ðŸ§  Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning â€“ Spine Classification

This is my classification project exploring the use of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to classify spine abnormalities from biomechanical indicators. It was submitted for the **Statistics & Machine Learning module** as part of my MSc Data Science.

ðŸ§ª **Objective:** Classify orthopaedic patients as normal or abnormal using -
- Unsupervised Learning: Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to discover inherent structure in data
- Supervised Learning: Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify new samples using past labels

---

 ðŸ“Š **Data Preprocessing**
 - Outlier Handling: RobustScaler on grade_of_spondylolisthesis
 - Normalisation: Standard scaling for clustering
 - Dimensionality Reduction: PCA to 2 components for model optimisation & visualisation

**ðŸ¥¸ Reflections:** SVM is more robust for medical datasets, while GMM adds exploratory insights.
